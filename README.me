Facebook Friends Graph is a replacement for defunct Wolfram Alpha's facebook graph network visualizer.

Since FB disabled the proper API, FFG scraps `m.facebook.com` so it only works with disabled same-origin policy. A `package.json` file is included for `node-webkit`. FFG should soon be available on the Firefox Marketplace.
